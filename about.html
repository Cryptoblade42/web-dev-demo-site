        <p>Hey! I'm Sarah and I'm the Vice President of MonSec. I study law and computer science and I am interested
            in
            both the technical and legal sides of cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>Outside of that, I like playing video games, teaching coding/robotics and origami. In case you can't tell
            already, I also like cats (and dogs, don't worry).</p>
