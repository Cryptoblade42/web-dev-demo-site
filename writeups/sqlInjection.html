        <h2>What are Databases? What is SQL?</h2>
        <p>A database is simply an ordered collection of data stored in a 'table'. SQL is the language used to retrieve
            information from that table using 'queries'. There are different versions of SQL (ignoring NoSQL and
            non-relational databases) and while the syntax is slightly different, the overall idea is the same.</p>

        <h2>What is SQLi?</h2>
        <p>SQLi, short for SQL Injection, is the process of creating malicious queries, which can be 'injected' into a
            database, causing unintended behaviour. For example, SQLi can be used to bypass a login page, or to retrieve
            hidden data about other users. It is a reasonably common attack, despite how well-known it is. Nevertheless,
            there are a few good ways to defend against SQLi, such as the use of prepared statements and parameterised
            queries.</p>

        <h2>What are Some Common SQLi Payloads?</h2>
        <p>Because of the nature of SQLi, there are usually a few common payloads which can be quickly used to test if a
            website is vulnerable. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>[username]'--</b> can be used to bypass a login page by forcing the database to ignore the password
                check (since it is commented out by the '--'). It can be injected into the username field, with a known
                username. </li>
            <li><b>â€˜OR 1=1--</b> can be used to bypass either a catalogue filter or a login page, depending where it is
                injected. Essentially, this command will replace a given parameter (or add one, should one not exist
                already) with a condition that is <i>always true</i>. This essentially eliminates the condition, as the
                query will boil down to 'do something if [condition is true] or [1=1 is true]'. Since the latter is
                always true, the 'something' will always execute. In the context of a catalogue, this means we can
                eliminate any other filter (e.g. 'search only for released items') and for login pages, we can insert
                this instead of a password (i.e. 'login if we have username X and 1=1').</li>
            <li><b>'UNION SELECT NULL--</b> is used for more advanced UNION-based attacks. This command is used to
                enumerate the number of columns in a table, because in a UNION attack, the number of columns must always
                match. We can then keep adding NULLs (i.e. we would write 'UNION SELECT NULL, NULL-- and then 'UNION
                SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--) until we don't get an error- then we know we have the length (number of
                NULLs). Alternatively,
                we can replace a NULL with a random string/number to determine the type of data stored in that column.
                E.g. if we replace one NULL with 'abc' (a string) and don't get an error, then we know that that column
                will contain strings.</li>
            <li><b>'UNION SELECT [column_name], [optional_second_column] FROM [table_name]--</b> is a payload used to
                retrieve data using a UNION attack. Essentially, once we have the number of columns, we can insert the
                correct number of columns (assuming we have the names of the columns we want) and then we can get the
                information we want.</li>
        </ul>
