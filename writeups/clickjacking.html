        <h2>What is Clickjacking?</h2>
        <p>Clickjacking is the process of tricking a user into performing an action, such as clicking on a button, by
            disguising what they're actually doing. This is done by creating a 'mask' which is placed 'on top of' the
            original website, so the user doesn't know what they're actually clicking on. It's commonly used alongside
            social engineering attacks, like phishing.</p>

        <h2>How Can You Prevent Clickjacking?</h2>
        <p>There are a few ways to protect against clickjacking, beyond 'not clicking on suspicious things'. The main
            idea is to prevent the website from being 'framed', i.e. it cannot be placed underneath a mask using an
            iframe. This can be achieved by configuring the X-Frame-Options header, using a strict CSP, implementing
            SameSite cookies and/or implementing a frame buster script. Naturally, these techniques are not fool-proof,
            and can be bypassed if not correctly implemented.</p>
