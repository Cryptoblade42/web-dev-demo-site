        <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h2>
        <p>XSS is a common class of vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into a victim's
            webpage. There are three different types of XSS: Reflected, Stored and DOM XSS. While they can achieve
            similar results, their mechanisms are slightly different. Reflected XSS triggers 'immediately', as the data
            received in the malicious HTTP request is returned in the next response. Stored XSS is triggered when
            something else happens, for example, a user visits the page. This is because the payload is 'stored'
            somewhere before being returned in a later response. Finally, DOM XSS works by having an untrusted source
            connected to the DOM through an unsafe sink, which is a client-side (not server-side) vulnerability. Like
            with stored XSS, there are many ways for a DOM XSS vulnerability to be 'triggered'.</p>

        <h2>How can XSS Be Prevented?</h2>
        <p>There are a few ways to prevent XSS. One way is to use a strong content security policy (CSP) which prevents
            scripts from being executed unless it comes from a certain domain/the same source. You could also perform
            user-input sanitation, using libraries like DOMPurify. Sometimes, blacklists/whitelists and encoding can be
            used, though they are often weaker defences as there is a good chance of an attacker being able to bypass
            the filters.</p>
