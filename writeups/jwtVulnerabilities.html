        <h2>What are JWTs?</h2>
        <p>JSON web tokens, or JWTs for short (pronounced 'jort' or 'jot'), are signed tokens that can be used to store
            data. This data can then be sent securely between parties. For example, it might contain a user's name and
            their unique id number. Their security comes from the fact that they are signed with a secret, using some
            algorithm. If the signature doesn't match, the token is invalid. Any time a change is made to the header or
            the payload of the token, the signature must be correctly updated. This is why an attacker cannot simply
            tamper with or modify a JWT in the same way that they can just change a cookie.</p>

        <h2>What are Some JWT Vulnerabilities?</h2>
        <p>Hypothetically, JWTs aren't vulnerable: If you don't have the secret, you can't sign the token correctly and
            it'll be rejected. However, JWTs, or the systems that check their integirty, can be implemented poorly,
            making them exploitable. For example, the system may not actually check the signature's correctness, nor
            might it check for the presence of an algorithm with which to check the signature. In more complex cases, an
            attacker can cause a site to sign tokens with their own secrets/keys, using JWT header injections, allowing them
            to modify the tokens and re-sign them correctly.</p>
