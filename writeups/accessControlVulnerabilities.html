        <h2>What are Access Controls?</h2>
        <p>Access controls are methods used to restrict and control access to certain actions or information. They can
            be physical (like locks on doors) or digital (like login pages). Good access controls are important for
            security. A good access control is one that can authenticate, authorise and audit users.</p>

        <h2>What are Some of the Possible Vulnerabilities?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, access controls are not as strong as we'd like them to be. Some of the reasons access controls
            might be weak are that they can be tampered/manipulated, bypassed or forged.</p>
