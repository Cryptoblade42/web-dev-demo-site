        <h2>What is Information Disclosure?</h2>
        <p>Information disclosure, in the context of web security, is the process of finding unintentional leaks of
            information about a site. This might be login credentials, information about the backend systems or details
            of other users. This information can then be compiled and used to form a tailored payload. Some of the ways
            information can be accidentally leaked include error messages and hidden content on websites, such as the
            robots.txt page.</p>

        <h2>How Do You Find Business Logic Vulnerabilities?</h2>
        <p>Essentially, this class of vulnerabilities is focussing on disrupting the logical flow of a website, leading
            to unexpected consequences. For example, you could trick a shop into setting the prices of all the items to
            $0. While these vulnerabilities are less technical, they can still be challenging to find, as one must be
            familiar with how the website actually works, in order to exploit and disrupt it.</p>
