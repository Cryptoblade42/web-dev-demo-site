        <h2>What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?</h2>
        <p>CSRF attacks are a close cousin of XSS attacks, but rather than injecting arbitrary code, a CSRF attack
            allows an attacker to 'hijack' a user's actions. That is to say, an attacker can induce a user into
            performing an action that the user did not intend to perform. An example of this is an attacker inducing a
            user into changing their email into the attacker's email instead. CSRF attacks are generally less dangerous
            than XSS attacks, due to the fact that their scope is inherently limited to actions that their target victim
            can perform. The more privileged a victim is (i.e. can do 'more things'), the more damaging a CSRF attack
            can be.</p>

        <h2>How can CSRF attacks Be Prevented?</h2>
        <p>Fortunately, CSRF defence mechanisms are usually quite robust, if implemented correctly. Some such mechanisms
            are the use of SameSite Cookies, CSRF tokens and multi-step actions.</p>
