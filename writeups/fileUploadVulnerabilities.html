        <h2>What's a Webshell?</h2>
        <p>A webshell is a malicious piece of code that an attacker can sneak into a system, so that they can remotely
            access and interact with the target system. A common way to get a webshell into a system is through a file
            upload vulnerability. As most web servers use PHP, a lot of webshells are written as
            PHP scripts, though sometimes Python, Perl, Ruby, Java or other languages are used.</p>

        <h2>How Do Developers Prevent File Upload Vulnerabilities?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of ways to prevent file upload vulnerabilities, though their efficacy depends greatly on
            how well they have been implemented. For example, a blacklist can be set up to block all malicious file
            types. However, it will only work if the file type is correctly checked/identified and the blacklist is
            complete. Similarly, the location of the file can be obscured, but an enumeration attack or path traversal
            vulnerability may negate its effect.</p>
