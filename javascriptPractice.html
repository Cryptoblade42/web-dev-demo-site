        <h2>What is JavaScript (JS)?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. Often, you will see it written as 'JS'
            for short. It can be used for many different things, such as the creation of dynamic websites, animations
            and data manipulation. It can also be used by web security specialists, who often write payloads for
            websites in JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>My First JS Script</h2>
        <label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
        <input id="name">

        <p id="output"></p>

        <button class="button hover-button" onclick="generateCompliment()">Compliment me!</button>
        <br>
        <script>
            function generateCompliment() { // This is the name of our function: Everything between the {} will be part of the function. The () denotes it as a function
                // We need to take the name from the 'name' input box, which we gave an id of 'name'
                // We store it in a variable called nameInput, so we can insert it into our compliments later
                let nameInput = document.querySelector("#name");

                // Now, we create an 'array' of compliments- essentially a list of compliments
                // Each one is enclosed in "" and is separated by a comma
                // Everything is enclosed by the []
                // You can add however many compliments as you want, and you can change them- just keep the format roughly the same
                var compliments = [
                    "You look great today!",
                    "On a scale of 1-10, you're a solid 11!",
                    "You have a pretty smile :)",
                    "Your sense of humour can cheer anyone up.",
                    "You're going to ace that next assignment!",
                    "Even Keanu Reeves would say you're breathtaking!",
                    "You must be CSS, since you've got class and style."
                ];

                // Now, we choose a random compliment, by choosing a random number which will correspond to one of the compliments
                // Then, we can 'append' a quick greeting and the name of the user by using +
                let compliment = "Hey, " + nameInput.value + "! " + compliments[getRandomNumber(compliments.length)];
            
                output.innerHTML = compliment;
            }

            // Here is our 'random number generator', which we will use to randomly choose a compliment
            function getRandomNumber(numberOfCompliments) {
                return Math.floor(Math.random() * numberOfCompliments);
